  <h2>Aquiles' walk</h2>

<p> Achilles has a distance of 20m to be covered but following the Zenon paradox: at each walk he goes half of the last walk, or half of what he still needs to, and so forth. 
  The numbers in 'Walk' indicate the number of times he walks and those in 'Distance' indicate the meters he still has to go.</p>

<p> Will he reach the end?</p>
